Welcome to xarrayutils's documentation!
=======================================

This documentation is a work in progress.

I started **xarrayutils** as a container for some useful tools that are somewhat
specialized, but which I would reuse often in my scientific projects.

Some are a complete mess and others are tested and halfway decently developed.
